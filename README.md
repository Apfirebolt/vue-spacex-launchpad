## Project Briefing

This uses open API provided by SpaceX which is related to missions they've launched over the years. This displays details related to it through a beautiful user interface and filters provided. This uses Vue-Tailwind UI library in Vue for UI components which are powered by Tailwind CSS.

Tried to convert the app to Vue 3 using Vite but just came to know that the UI library used in this 'vue-tailwind' is no longer maintained and is not supported for Vue 3. In place of this, Headless UI can be used.

## Testing

Testing using Vitest and vue-test-utils for Vue 3.

```
npm i vitest @#vue/test-utils@next
npm i happy-dom
```

Add test script in your package.json file

```
"test": "vitest"
```

Happy Dom package would help mimicking the browser environment inside Node.
